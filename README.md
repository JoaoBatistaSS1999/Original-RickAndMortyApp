<h1>This is a remake of and old project</h1>

<p>
  The reason for this remake is that the website was too simple to even deserve
  its own repo. Plus, I wanted to use some new knowledge I acquired over the
  last couple of weeks such as: Typescript, Axios, Next.js and (finally, giving
  up vanilla CSS to use a library ðŸ˜”) Material UI.
